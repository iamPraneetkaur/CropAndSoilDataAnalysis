# 🌾 Crop Analysis Dashboard – Power BI Project

## 📘 Overview  
This project presents an end-to-end **agriculture analytics dashboard** built using **Power BI**.  
It analyzes how **soil type, climate conditions, and nutrient levels (NPK)** impact crop growth and fertilizer usage.  
The goal is to support **data-driven and sustainable farming decisions** through clear visual insights.

---

## 📊 Dataset Summary  
The dataset includes the following features:

- **Temperature**  
- **Humidity**  
- **Moisture**  
- **Soil Type**  
- **Crop Type**  
- **Nitrogen (N)**  
- **Phosphorus (P)**  
- **Potassium (K)**  
- **Fertilizer Name**

The data was cleaned, validated, and prepared before dashboard development.

## 🖥️ Dashboard Features  

### **1. Overview Page**
- Crop distribution  
- Soil type distribution  
- Temperature vs Humidity analysis  
- Moisture comparison across soil types  
- Interactive slicers  

### **2. Nutrient (NPK) Analysis Page**
- Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium by crop  
- Multi-nutrient comparison  
- Soil type vs nutrient matrix  
- Conditional formatting visuals  

### **3. Fertilizer Insights Page**
- Fertilizer usage patterns  
- Crop–fertilizer mapping  
- Soil–fertilizer suitability  
- NPK–fertilizer relationships  

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Clayey soil retains the highest moisture; sandy soil retains the least.  
- Nitrogen levels are significantly higher than phosphorus and potassium.  
- Different crops show distinct soil and climate preferences.  
- Fertilizers such as Urea and DAP are used heavily but not always optimally.  

---

## 💡 Recommendations
- Choose crops based on soil suitability to improve yield.  
- Use balanced NPK fertilizers rather than relying heavily on nitrogen-rich fertilizers.  
- Adopt moisture-based irrigation scheduling for efficient water usage.  
- Match fertilizer selection with each crop’s nutrient requirement.  

---

### **Crop Recommendation Model**
Predicts the ideal crop based on soil, climate, and nutrient inputs.

### **Fertilizer Recommendation Model**
Predicts the best fertilizer based on crop and nutrient levels.
